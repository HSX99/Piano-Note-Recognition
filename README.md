# Piano-Note-Recognition
Piano Note recognition software using MATLAB. 
I have designed and implemented an effective and user-friendly frequency estimation system with Fourier Analysis. This project is implemented by using Windowing technique to seperate and match the note as per the given one, along with plotting of the note in the graph in time and frequency domain.
